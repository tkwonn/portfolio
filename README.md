  Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio project designed to showcase my personal background, skills, and projects.   
While it serves as a portfolio, the main objective is to gain experience in setting up a web server and deploying a static site to a cloud platform.

For easier future updates, Iâ€™ve organized my project to require changes solely in the JSON within the `projects.ts` file, rather than across multiple files (same for `experiences.ts` and `skills.ts`)

```TypeScript
export const projectsData = [
    {
      imageUrl: '',
      title: '',
      description: '',
      tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
      githubUrl: '',
      appUrl: '',
    },
    {
      imageUrl: '',
      title: '',
      description: '',
      tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
      githubUrl: '',
      appUrl: '',
    },
    ...
] as const;
```
